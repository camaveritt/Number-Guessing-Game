This project is an interactive random number guessing game. A shell script generates a random number between 1 and 1000, accepts a guess from the user, and returns feedback to the user based on their guess, until the correct number is guessed.  Username, number of guesses, and best game score for each user are all collected and stored in a PostgreSQL database .
